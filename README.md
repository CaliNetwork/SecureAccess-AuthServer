SecureAccess™ Server
===
Manage your servers feels like using a f*king cannon s*x machine, 100% a beast.

Okay, this is a Server for SecureAccess™, what it does is to do some auth stuffs with TOTP(Time-based one time password)

It can be a daemon(like howdy on linux) for auth, a webpanel, a cluster management software and an alternative to SSH(Secure Shell)

In another word, if you want to read:```SecureAccess is a robust and comprehensive software solution designed to manage a vast array of devices. It serves as an opensourced alternative to the traditional SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.```

```
It feels so good
